## Who is Peribot?

Peribot is a modular discord bot written in Python based on the Steven Universe character [Peridot](https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Peridot).

## Why should you use Peribot?

Peribot is an ever evolving bot that is constantly adding features as I aim to make this bot the "one stop shop" for discord admins. Personally I dislike servers that utilize more than a handful of bots. Its hard to remember commands, prefix's clash, things like economy plugins don't have uses outside of that specific bot, etc.
